My Blog--[Mr.傅的专栏](http://blog.csdn.net/fu222cs98/)

Rarely updated blog, but I will post more project to github, I will try to blog much more, although my poor literary talent, but also how good the technology is not necessarily

## 描述

第一个版本是我刚开始学习 Android 没多久之后写的，现在我重新将其实现了一次，这一次，我采用 AlarmManager 来实现定时功能，我想应该可以在一定程度上减少电量的消耗了。我也重新设计了界面，让它变的稍微好看了那么一点点

eg：这是一个不完善的版本，我还没有加入上个版本的 TASK 的功能，我觉得上个版本的 TASK 写的太丑了，而且操作太麻烦了，所以，我决定后面花时间重新来实现一个 TASK，可以期待期待。
eg2：这个应用参考了 极简番茄 和 ClearFocus 这两个应用，当然，只是参考极少部分，下面会有链接的
eg3：后面会不断更新的- -。的，直到我将其发布到应用市场为止。喔，对了，这个应该还被豌豆荚评为了“优质应用”了，虽然下载量和后来出现的番茄土豆比起来弱爆了（番茄土豆真的很不错，但是它太复杂了， ^ ^）
eg4：这个是豌豆荚 1.0.2版本的链接：[点我，点我，点我去豌豆荚](http://www.wandoujia.com/apps/com.android.tomatotask)

## describe

The first version of Android that I just started learning when to write, and now I'm back to make it happen again, this time, I used AlarmManager to achieve timing, I think I should be able to reduce power consumption to some extent on the. I also redesigned the interface, it becomes a little good-looking a little

eg: This is an imperfect version, I have not joined TASK functionality of the previous version, and I think the last version of the TASK write ugly, and the operation is too much trouble, so I decided to come back to take the time to re- achieve a TASK, you can look forward to look forward to.
eg2: This application references ‘Simple Pomodoro’ and ‘ClearFocus’ these two applications, of course, only a very small part reference, the following will be linked
eg3: behind will continue to update the - -. Until I publish it to the application market so far. Oh, yes, this should also named a pea pod "Quality Applications", although downloads and the subsequent emergence of tomato potatoes compared to weak burst (tomato potato is really good, but it was too complicated, ^ ^)
eg4: This is a pea pod version 1.0.2 link: [points to me, point me and point me to the pea pod]
